## Choices

- DDD tactical patterns
  - *Aggregate* ([read](https://vaughnvernon.co/?p=838))
  - *Entity* ([read](http://thepaulrayner.com/blog/aggregates-and-entities-in-domain-driven-design/))
  - *Value Object* ([read](https://dev.to/flbenz/kotlin-and-domain-driven-design-value-objects-4m32))
  - *Domain Event* ([read](http://verraes.net/2014/11/domain-events/))
  - *Repository*
- *Aggregate* ids are provided by their *event store* ([read](https://matthiasnoback.nl/2018/05/when-and-where-to-determine-the-id-of-an-entity/))
- *Aggregate* ids have their own types ([read](https://buildplease.com/pages/vo-ids/))
  - use ULIDs instead of UUIDs ([read](https://sudhir.io/uuids-ulids))
- *Aggregate roots* are constructed through factory methods ([read](https://buildplease.com/pages/constructing-aggregates/))
- *Domain events* are put aside during the aggregate's execution, then "collected" and published by the use case ([read](https://lostechies.com/jimmybogard/2014/05/13/a-better-domain-events-pattern/))
- all objects are closed for extension by default ([read](https://ocramius.github.io/blog/when-to-declare-classes-final/))
- use *factory methods* instead of being limited to just constructors ([read](http://verraes.net/2014/06/named-constructors-in-php/))
- avoid *get/set* prefixes ([read](https://blog.pragmatists.com/refactoring-from-anemic-model-to-ddd-880d3dd3d45f))
- exception messages are hidden in the exception classes ([read](http://rosstuck.com/formatting-exception-messages))
